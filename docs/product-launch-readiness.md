# ReplyTrail: critical path to product release

Reassessed: 2026-10-08. This list contains critical bugs to fix first, the two product features selected for this release, and the in-progress review of the Alert Escalation v1 requirements. Scheduling has focused PostgreSQL integration coverage with a simulated broker; the deployed end-to-end release journey remains unverified.

## Alert Escalation v1 requirements review

Review these requirements in order. A checked **Requirements agreed** box means the product behaviour and acceptance criteria are settled; it does not mean implementation is complete. Implementation progress is tracked separately.

### 1. Scheduled escalation start

- [x] **Requirements agreed**
- [x] **Implementation complete locally — durable `START_FAILED` notification and Start now**
- [ ] **Implemented and verified in PostgreSQL/deployed flow**
- **Requested behaviour:** When creating an escalation, choose **Start immediately** or **Schedule for later**. A scheduled escalation stores a date, time, and timezone, remains `SCHEDULED` until its start time, and then enters the same workflow as an immediate escalation. Before it starts, it can be rescheduled or cancelled. Only one-time schedules are in v1. If all start attempts fail, the responsible users must be notified; that notification must survive an application crash or restart.
- **Current state:** The core local scheduling implementation is complete. The escalation stores a one-time UTC start instant and IANA timezone, exposes create/reschedule/cancel actions, schedules starts in memory from the durable database row, recovers scheduled rows on startup, and atomically claims a scheduled start before creating response steps. Exhausted retries produce `START_FAILED` and create one durable notification obligation per responsible recipient; startup recovery can deliver obligations that remained pending across a crash. PostgreSQL integration and deployed end-to-end verification remain pending.
- **Agreed product decisions:**
  - Put the schedule on the escalation run, not on the reusable task or escalation path.
  - Accept a local date/time plus an IANA timezone such as `Asia/Kolkata`; persist both the resolved UTC instant and the submitted timezone for accurate display and rescheduling.
  - Reject a scheduled time that is not in the future. Default the UI timezone to the browser timezone and allow the user to change it.
  - Allow reschedule and cancel only while the run is still `SCHEDULED`, enforced atomically so a start cannot race with either action.
  - Treat **Start immediately** as create-and-start, using the same start use case invoked when a scheduled time becomes due.
  - Allow **Start now** to start a scheduled run early through the existing manual start API. Commit `SCHEDULED → OPEN` and step creation before cancelling the in-memory start timer. Send the first email immediately; its configured acknowledgement wait begins after delivery. This extension is implemented locally; PostgreSQL/deployed verification remains pending. See the [shared lifecycle plan](resolution-timeout-implementation-plan.md#how-start-now-will-work).
  - Add a terminal `CANCELLED` state for a cancelled scheduled run, consistent with the incident lifecycle in Requirement 2.
  - When the retry limit is exhausted, change the escalation to `START_FAILED` and atomically persist a pending failure-notification obligation in PostgreSQL. Do not rely on the scheduler callback or an in-memory queue to remember that notification.
  - Notify the user who scheduled the escalation and the team owner or administrators. If the application stops after recording `START_FAILED` but before notification delivery, startup recovery must find the pending notification and send it when the application is available again.
  - Record successful delivery so normal recovery does not resend it. Prefer at-least-once delivery over losing the notification; the implementation must tolerate the narrow possibility of a duplicate if the application stops after the provider accepts the notification but before delivery is recorded.
- **Verification needed:** API validation and team isolation; timezone and daylight-saving conversion; start-at-time behaviour; restart recovery; duplicate trigger safety; reschedule/start and cancel/start races; UI state and actions; proof that recurring or cron schedules are not accepted; exhausted retries persist `START_FAILED` and pending notification together; notification-delivery failure remains recoverable; application restart sends pending notifications; repeated recovery does not create avoidable duplicates; the correct user and team administrators are notified.
- **Evidence:** [schedule migration](../src/main/resources/db/migration/V6__add_escalation_scheduling.sql), [failure-notification migration](../src/main/resources/db/migration/V10__add_scheduled_start_failure_notifications.sql), [scheduled-start scheduler](../src/main/java/com/alertops/flow_execution_engine/service/EscalationStartScheduler.java), [failure-notification service](../src/main/java/com/alertops/flow_execution_engine/service/EscalationStartFailureNotificationService.java), [start claims](../src/main/java/com/alertops/flow_execution_engine/repository/EscalationRepository.java), [creation UI](../ui/src/features/escalations/EscalationsPage.tsx), [schedule controls and failure state](../ui/src/features/escalations/EscalationDetailPage.tsx), [notification tests](../src/test/java/com/alertops/flow_execution_engine/service/EscalationStartFailureNotificationServiceTest.java).
- **Local verification:** Focused scheduling/retry/notification tests, early-start/controller tests, backend packaging, and `npm run build` pass. PostgreSQL/Testcontainers integration coverage is currently skipped in this environment, so the final readiness box stays open.

#### Recurring schedules — planned extension

- [x] **Minimum scope defined; defaults selected**
- [x] **Minimum implementation complete locally**
- [ ] **Locally and deployed verified**
- **Agreed direction:** One recurring schedule creates independent escalation
  runs with different IDs. Runs may overlap; an unresolved previous run does not
  block the next calendar occurrence. Preserve the existing one-time behavior.
- **Storage agreed:** Keep recurrence on the original escalation in the existing
  table with repeatType, nextRepeatAt, and repeatSourceId. Generated runs do not
  repeat themselves. Do not add a separate recurring-schedule table or lifecycle.
- **Plan:** [Recurring escalation implementation plan](recurring-escalation-implementation-plan.md).
  Start with daily/weekly repeats on scheduled starts, stop-repeat, and only the
  latest missed repeat after downtime. Fixed timezone/DST defaults are recorded;
  monthly/yearly repeats, editing, custom intervals, previews, and extra history
  views are deferred. This planned extension does not change one-time readiness
  or claim deployed verification.
- **Local state:** Daily/weekly recurrence, independent child runs, stop-repeat,
  durable next-repeat recovery, and existing-screen controls are implemented.
  Calendar unit coverage, backend compilation/package, UI build/lint, and diff
  checks pass. Mockito service tests are environment-blocked by Byte Buddy
  self-attachment; PostgreSQL and deployed verification remain pending.

### 2. Incident lifecycle

- [x] **Requirements agreed**
- [x] **Implementation complete locally**
- [ ] **Implemented and verified in PostgreSQL/deployed flow**
- **Requested behaviour:** Every escalation follows one explicit lifecycle. Status changes happen only through named operations, invalid transitions are rejected consistently, simultaneous actions cannot both win, and terminal history remains available for investigation.
- **Agreed baseline statuses:** Requirement 3 below adds the optional acknowledgement/resolution lifecycle. The enabled `ACKNOWLEDGED` state, acknowledgement pause, explicit `RESOLVED` transition, and deadline expiry/recovery are implemented locally; deployed verification remains pending.
  - `IDLE`: created but not started or scheduled.
  - `SCHEDULED`: waiting for its configured start time or an eligible start retry.
  - `OPEN`: actively processing response steps and waiting for acknowledgement.
  - `ACKNOWLEDGED`: the current recipient owns an active resolution window; the next step is paused until resolution or timeout.
  - `COMPLETED`: terminal; `ACKNOWLEDGED` or `EXHAUSTED` records why it completed.
  - `CANCELLED`: terminal; a scheduled escalation was cancelled before starting.
  - `START_FAILED`: terminal for v1; all scheduled-start attempts were exhausted.
- **Agreed baseline transitions:**
  - `IDLE` may become `OPEN` through **Start escalation** or `SCHEDULED` through **Schedule later**.
  - `SCHEDULED` may become `OPEN` when its due start succeeds or an authenticated same-team **Start now** claim wins early. It may remain `SCHEDULED` when rescheduled or when another start retry is allowed, become `CANCELLED` when cancellation wins first, or become `START_FAILED` when all retries are exhausted.
  - Without resolution timeout, `OPEN` becomes `COMPLETED` when the intended recipient acknowledges it or when every response step is exhausted. With resolution timeout enabled, acknowledgement enters `ACKNOWLEDGED` until resolution or timeout.
  - `COMPLETED`, `CANCELLED`, and `START_FAILED` do not transition again in v1. A manual retry for `START_FAILED` is post-release work.
- **Agreed baseline action behaviour:**
  - A repeated acknowledgement by the same recipient returns the saved result. Another recipient cannot overwrite it, and an `EXHAUSTED` escalation cannot be acknowledged later.
  - Repeated cancellation is idempotent and returns the existing cancelled result.
  - Scheduled timer callbacks reload the database row and stop when the escalation is no longer `SCHEDULED`. Terminal runs are read-only and remain visible for history.
  - All authenticated members of the selected team may create, start, schedule, reschedule, cancel, and view escalations in v1. Email acknowledgement requires the valid recipient token; automatic transitions are backend-only; another team's escalation is never exposed.
- **Concurrency rule:** The first valid database transition that commits wins. Conditional updates or row locks enforce the decision; a stale request returns a conflict and an internal stale callback becomes a no-op. In-memory state never decides lifecycle ownership.
- **API behaviour:** Invalid input returns `400`, missing authentication returns `401`, missing or another-team escalation returns `404`, and an invalid transition returns `409`. Duplicate starts return `409`; repeated cancellation and same-recipient acknowledgement are idempotent successes.
- **Minimum v1 audit data:** Persist the scheduling user needed for failure notification, the latest scheduling actor after reschedule, start time, cancellation actor and time, start-failure time and safe reason, retry count, and the existing acknowledgement actor and time. A complete event timeline remains Requirement 5.
- **Audit boundary:** Lifecycle services decide and persist valid state transitions; `AuditService` persists append-only events for any entity. Audit storage is separate from domain models and uses an entity type/id, so adding event consumers or auditing another entity does not require changing the audited entity's model or repository. Audit writes join the same transaction as the lifecycle transition.
- **Implementation checklist:**
  - [x] Remove the generic `updateEscalationStatus` method so callers cannot assign arbitrary status and resolution strings.
  - [x] Centralize the allowed status and resolution values and prevent arbitrary values from being persisted.
  - [x] Add the minimum lifecycle actor, timestamp, and safe failure fields, including the scheduling user required for notification.
  - [x] Make repeated cancellation idempotent and return the saved cancelled result.
  - [x] Map validation, authentication, team isolation, and transition conflicts to the agreed HTTP responses through typed escalation errors, global bad-request handling, and the security authentication entry point.
  - [x] Add the durable `START_FAILED` notification and UI described in Requirement 1.
  - [x] Add focused transition, authorization, stale-callback, idempotency, and concurrency tests, including start/schedule, start/cancel, start/reschedule, acknowledgement/send, and failure/cancellation races.
  - [x] Progress: scheduled-start versus cancellation race and stale cancelled-timer callback are covered.
  - [x] Progress: scheduled-start versus reschedule race is covered.
  - [x] Progress: scheduling loses cleanly when an immediate start claims the idle escalation first.
  - [x] Progress: an exhausted start retry cannot overwrite a cancellation winner.
  - [x] Progress: anonymous schedule, reschedule, and cancel requests are rejected with `401`.
  - [x] Progress: scheduling lookups are team-scoped and do not expose another team's escalation.
- **Done when:** No generic status mutation path remains; every transition follows the agreed state graph and team boundary; concurrent actions have one winner; terminal states cannot be reopened; required audit data is saved; invalid actions return the agreed API response; and focused unit plus PostgreSQL integration tests prove the lifecycle.
- **Evidence:** [escalation service](../src/main/java/com/alertops/flow_execution_engine/service/EscalationService.java), [generic audit service](../src/main/java/com/alertops/audit/service/AuditService.java), [audit event model](../src/main/java/com/alertops/audit/model/AuditEventEntity.java), [audit event repository](../src/main/java/com/alertops/audit/repository/AuditEventRepository.java), [conditional transition queries](../src/main/java/com/alertops/flow_execution_engine/repository/EscalationRepository.java), [lifecycle database constraints](../src/main/resources/db/migration/V8__constrain_escalation_lifecycle_values.sql), [audit migration](../src/main/resources/db/migration/V9__create_audit_events.sql), [scheduled-start retry service](../src/main/java/com/alertops/flow_execution_engine/service/EscalationStartRetryService.java), [lifecycle tests](../src/test/java/com/alertops/flow_execution_engine/service/EscalationServiceSchedulingTest.java), [start use-case tests](../src/test/java/com/alertops/flow_execution_engine/application/StartFlowExecutionUseCaseTest.java), and [escalation access tests](../src/test/java/com/alertops/flow_execution_engine/controller/EscalationSecurityTest.java).

### 3. Resolution timeout after acknowledgement

- [x] **Requirements fully agreed**
- [x] **Implementation complete locally**
- [ ] **Implemented and verified in PostgreSQL/deployed flow**
- **Core decisions agreed:** The flow owns an optional resolution-timeout toggle. Disabled flows have no node resolution timeouts and retain today's terminal acknowledgement behavior. Enabled flows require a positive resolution timeout on every node, copied with the toggle into runtime state at escalation start. Use one notification-step enum with terminal `SENT`, `FAILED`, and `SKIPPED` outcomes.
- **Enabled behavior:** Acknowledgement of an exact sent step changes the run from `OPEN` to `ACKNOWLEDGED`, pauses the next scheduled step if present, and saves a UTC resolution deadline using that step's timeout. Resolution ends the run as `RESOLVED` and skips later unsent steps. If timeout wins first and a next step exists, resume `OPEN` and make it due immediately, even when its original due time is later. Do not restart the step delay or wait for the later of the two deadlines. With no next step, exhaust as described below.
- **Uniform final-node behavior agreed:** All nodes use the same node-owned acknowledgement/resolution waits, without a separate final-node setting. A successful final send stays open for acknowledgement. If its acknowledgement wait expires, or its enabled resolution wait expires unresolved, finish as `COMPLETED` / `EXHAUSTED`; do not resend or restart. Timely enabled resolution ends `RESOLVED`; disabled acknowledgement retains terminal `ACKNOWLEDGED` behavior. See [uniform node rules](resolution-timeout-implementation-plan.md#agreed-uniform-node-waits-and-final-step-outcome).
- **Two node durations agreed:** The existing delivery delay is the acknowledgement wait, not a separate additional setting. The first response email is sent immediately when an escalation starts, and its configured duration begins after delivery. If nobody acknowledges, that same wait expires and the next step becomes due. Timely acknowledgement with resolution enabled starts the resolution duration from acknowledgement and pauses progression. Unresolved resolution expiry makes the next step due immediately, without adding the original wait again. No third duration, separate send-delay control, or final-node exception is needed.
- **Links and action deadlines agreed:** Links remain viewable with safe read-only recipient context after a response deadline; new acknowledgement/resolution actions require current ownership and time strictly before their own saved deadline. Recheck on POST under the run lock, even after restart or when expiry callbacks are delayed. Timely acknowledgement keeps its separate resolution window. Repeat accepted actions show the saved result without restarting timers or reclaiming ownership. Invalid tokens still grant no access. See [link/action rules](resolution-timeout-implementation-plan.md#agreed-viewable-links-and-action-deadlines).
- **Resolution access settled:** Reuse existing same-team access in the UI and the current acknowledging recipient's scoped email link, enforcing the current resolution deadline and recording the actual actor. Node recipients already belong to the team; no extra role or state is needed.
- **Final lifecycle storage decision:** `RESOLVED` is self-describing and has no separate completion reason. `COMPLETED` requires `ACKNOWLEDGED` or `EXHAUSTED`; active acknowledgement owner/step/deadline fields are cleared when the run leaves `ACKNOWLEDGED`, while audit events retain the historical facts. Timing is settled: delivery delay and acknowledgement duration are the same wait. Node response durations, late-action rejection, resolution access, and email Escalate now source eligibility are settled; do not reopen those states or permissions.
- **Plan and implementation tracking:** [Resolution timeout implementation plan](resolution-timeout-implementation-plan.md). Work through its tasks one at a time. Agreed behavior is recorded; remaining design decisions and feature implementation are pending.
- **Progress:** The execution-step status foundation, flow/node timing configuration, runtime snapshots, exact acknowledgement token binding, acknowledgement pause, explicit resolution, deadline expiry/recovery, Escalate now, acknowledgement/resolution UI, and activity history are implemented locally: one string-persisted enum replaces the old execution/notification status pair, legacy rows are migrated, disabled acknowledgement marks unsent steps skipped, enabled acknowledgement stores `ACKNOWLEDGED` ownership/deadline and pauses the next step, successful sends persist the shared acknowledgement boundary, final waits recover after restart, unresolved resolution resumes the exact next step immediately or exhausts the run, authorized team/token actors can resolve before the saved deadline, OPEN/ACKNOWLEDGED manual escalation advances one expected next step with recipient-scoped email preview/confirmation, and lifecycle history is available through the safe paginated API and detail UI. PostgreSQL/deployed verification remains pending.
- **Verification needed:** PostgreSQL/deployed resolution/timeout races, delayed timers/restart, rollback, and durable publication under infrastructure failure. Local coverage includes final-node exhaustion, earlier/equal/later original due times, stale/duplicate callbacks, deadline action boundaries, and saved-result safety. Deployed checks are deferred until remaining implementation work is complete.

### 4. Escalate now

- [x] **Requirements agreed**
- [x] **Implementation complete locally**
- [ ] **Implemented and verified in PostgreSQL/deployed flow**
- **Requested behavior:** An authenticated team member, or an eligible notification recipient using a valid email token, can end the wait for the next notification and make that step due immediately, following saved step order. This differs from **Start now**, which begins a not-yet-started run with an immediate first email and its normal acknowledgement window.
- **Agreed decisions:** Allow the action when nobody has acknowledged (`OPEN`) and while somebody is working on resolution (`ACKNOWLEDGED`). In `OPEN`, the run stays open and the next eligible unsent step becomes due now. In `ACKNOWLEDGED`, confirm the user's intent, end the active resolution wait, return to `OPEN`, and make the next eligible paused step due now. Do not resend the previous notification or skip unfinished steps. No next eligible step or a terminal run means the action is unavailable. Sends already in progress finish normally.
- **Email action:** Add an **Escalate now** button opening a read-only preview/confirmation page that shows the current next recipient. Allow explicit POST confirmation without login using a hashed recipient token bound to the source step and validated against the expected target/current state. Before acknowledgement, only the current recipient within their acknowledgement window may act; after acknowledgement, only the current acknowledging recipient within their resolution window may act. At expiry or advancement, new actions are unavailable but the scoped link stays viewable. Opening/scanning never changes state. Reject invalid/foreign tokens, terminal runs, and no-next-step actions. Recheck ownership, deadline, and target under the run lock; repeated Step 1 confirmation cannot advance Step 3 after advancing Step 2. Audit the recipient email and affected steps; reuse the UI lifecycle operation. See [email source rules](resolution-timeout-implementation-plan.md#escalate-now-from-email).
- **State and reliability rules:** Reuse the step-status enum from Requirement 3. Bind manual requests to the expected step so duplicate/stale clicks cannot advance another step. Save the state change, due time, publication obligation, and actor audit together; change timers/publish only after commit. Manual escalation, timeout, and resolution must have one winner for the same acknowledgement/step. Reuse durable immediate-delivery scheduling with resolution timeout expiry.
- **Plan:** [Shared lifecycle plan and manual-action tasks](resolution-timeout-implementation-plan.md). Manual-action implementation is complete locally; PostgreSQL/deployed verification remains pending.
- **Verification needed:** Both OPEN/ACKNOWLEDGED paths from UI/email; immediate first email for idle, due scheduled, and early scheduled starts; first response window and later-step delay; no-next-step and terminal restrictions; authorization/team isolation and recipient-token scope; read-only viewable links and email action eligibility before/at/after the relevant deadline; invalid/foreign/stale tokens and changed preview targets; duplicate confirmation before/after target delivery and actor audit; manual start versus automatic start/cancel/reschedule; manual escalation versus send/acknowledgement/resolution/timeout; delayed/stale callbacks; rollback and durable publication/restart recovery.

### 5. Incident activity timeline

- [x] **Requirements agreed**
- [x] **Implementation complete locally**
- [ ] **Implemented and verified in PostgreSQL/deployed flow**
- **Requested behavior:** The escalation detail page shows saved chronological history of both user actions and automatic events, with the time, actor/system, and affected step/recipient. Terminal escalations retain history. Viewing history does not introduce or change lifecycle states.
- **Events:** Creation, scheduling, rescheduling, start (including early start), cancellation, notification send acceptance/failure/retries, acknowledgement and resolution deadline, resolution timeout, Escalate now from UI/email, resolution, completion/exhaustion, and start failure.
- **Agreed usability:** Show important milestones by default with plain wording. Group repeated failures/retries for the same step into a short summary with expandable attempt details and accurate retry counts; retain the full individual event history underneath. Keep timer housekeeping, stack traces, secrets, and raw tokens out of the timeline. Distinguish historical activity from the current step-progress display.
- **Audit/API plan:** Reuse the generic audit service; save each event with its owning domain change. Preserve event context despite later flow edits, avoid duplicate successful events from repeated requests/callbacks, and expose a safe, paginated, same-team history API. Email action tokens do not grant access to full team history.
- **Current state:** The audit service stores creation, scheduling, start, cancellation, notification acceptance/failure/retry, acknowledgement/deadline, manual escalation, resolution/timeout, start failure, and final exhaustion events. The same-team paginated history API exposes safe saved activity rows, and the escalation detail page now shows readable milestone history separately from current step progress, with grouped expandable retries and load-more support. PostgreSQL/deployed verification remains pending.
- **Local verification:** Focused audit/history coverage, UI build/lint, full Maven packaging, and diff checks pass. UI lint retains two pre-existing warnings in the flow detail page; browser/deployed verification remains unavailable.
- **Plan:** [Shared activity timeline design and tasks](resolution-timeout-implementation-plan.md#agreed-incident-activity-timeline).
- **Verification needed:** Event coverage and rollback atomicity, email/system actors, repeated/stale operation safety, stable chronology, grouping/counts across pages, readable messages, safe metadata, flow-edit history preservation, authorization/team isolation, loading/empty/error/refresh states, and terminal history. Deployed verification stays deferred.

### Deferred post-launch feature

- **Send test escalation** is deferred until real users start using the product. It is not an initial-launch requirement; revisit scope and priority using user feedback. Track it in the [feature backlog](feature-backlog.md#send-test-escalation).

## Fix these bugs first, in order

### 1. Close public account deletion

- [x] Disable `DELETE /api/v1/auth/user` until safe self-service deletion semantics are defined. The old endpoint accepted a caller-supplied email or ID under a publicly permitted auth route. The route is denied in security configuration, the handler and email-delete path are removed, and `UserRepository` now uses UUID IDs to match the entity.
- [x] Add focused API tests confirming anonymous and authenticated requests are denied and do not call the user service.
- **Done when:** the unsafe route stays unavailable until safe self-service deletion semantics are defined; focused API tests cover the denial.
- **Evidence:** [auth controller](../src/main/java/com/alertops/auth/controller/UserController.java), [security rules](../src/main/java/com/alertops/security/SecurityConfig.java), [user repository](../src/main/java/com/alertops/auth/repository/UserRepository.java).

### 2. Make escalation execution safe under duplicate messages and restarts

- [x] Reload the saved step for each queue message and atomically claim an eligible delivery. Ignore duplicate deliveries and messages for an older send attempt. Unit tests cover these consumer decisions, and PostgreSQL integration tests prove concurrent deliveries can claim a step only once.
- [x] When an unexpected processing error occurs, look for the next `PENDING` step before deciding the escalation is exhausted.
- [x] Persist each step's due time and pending-publication flag on the execution-state row. Publish immediately after the scheduling transaction commits, confirm RabbitMQ acceptance, and retry failed publications while the backend remains running. Startup recovery republishes outstanding steps with only the remaining delay; there is no separate outbox table or recurring idle poll. Existing active steps without a due time are recovered from their saved timestamps.
- [x] Claim a start by changing the escalation from `IDLE` to `OPEN` with a conditional database update, so only one simultaneous request can create step states.
- [x] Add database integration tests proving that duplicate starts create one state set. Concurrent delivery claims are already covered in PostgreSQL.
- **Done when:** duplicate messages, repeated starts, consumer crashes, and application restarts do not skip or advance a step twice; the remaining SMTP uncertainty after a send succeeds but before the database records it is explicitly handled or documented. Focused integration tests exercise these cases.
- **Evidence:** [consumer](../src/main/java/com/alertops/messaging/MessageConsumer.java), [reconciler](../src/main/java/com/alertops/messaging/ReconcilerService.java), [publisher](../src/main/java/com/alertops/messaging/MessagePublisher.java), [start use case](../src/main/java/com/alertops/flow_execution_engine/application/StartFlowExecutionUseCase.java).

The scheduling integration tests cover publication after commit, no publication on rollback, startup recovery, failed-publication retries, preserved due times, and late confirmations for old attempts. Recovery checks run on startup or after a publication failure; a healthy idle backend does not poll the database. SMTP remains outside the database transaction: if the mail server accepts an email and the backend stops before `SENT` commits, redelivery can send that email again. The scheduling fix does not guarantee exactly-once email delivery.

### 3. Verify the email address used to accept an invitation

- [x] Registration creates an unverified account and sends a one-time, expiring verification link. Login rejects unverified accounts before issuing a JWT, and the UI routes them to the verification screen.
- [x] Invitation acceptance checks the current database user, requires a verified address, and compares that address with the invite before creating membership.
- **Done when:** an unverified account cannot accept an invite for its claimed address; verified accounts can accept once; tests cover wrong account, expired link, repeat acceptance, and the verification state change.
- **Evidence:** [verification service](../src/main/java/com/alertops/auth/service/EmailVerificationService.java), [registration](../src/main/java/com/alertops/auth/service/UserService.java), [security filter](../src/main/java/com/alertops/security/JwtAuthenticationFilter.java), [invite acceptance](../src/main/java/com/alertops/team/service/TeamInvitationService.java), [migration](../src/main/resources/db/migration/V2__add_email_verification.sql).

### 4. Align task description limits with the database

- [x] The task form accepts up to 1,000 characters, and migration V3 changes both `tasks.description` and `flow_execution_state.task_details` to PostgreSQL `TEXT`. The saved task context can therefore survive task creation, run start, and email creation without the original 255-character database limit.
- **Done when:** the allowed maximum length survives task creation, run start, saved state reads, and email creation.
- **Evidence:** [task form](../ui/src/features/tasks/TasksPage.tsx), [task entity](../src/main/java/com/alertops/task/model/Task.java), [context migration](../src/main/resources/db/migration/V3__use_text_for_task_context.sql).

## Then build these two product features

### Feature 1: Acknowledge an escalation from email

- [x] Put an **Acknowledge** button in every escalation email. It opens a confirmation page for that specific run and recipient. The confirmation action records acknowledgement and stops later steps. The link uses a recipient-scoped, expiring token; only its hash is stored.
- [x] Make confirmation a deliberate `POST`; the email link opens a page and a read-only preview first. The worker and acknowledgement action lock the run row while making their state changes. If a send is already in progress, it finishes before acknowledgement is accepted; ready later steps then see the completed run and are ignored. The run detail shows who acknowledged and when.
- [x] Focused tests cover valid, expired, repeated, invalid-state, and wrong-recipient acknowledgement cases; anonymous API access is limited to the token endpoints and `GET` cannot confirm. A PostgreSQL integration case exercises acknowledgement while a send is in flight.
- **Done when:** acknowledgement before the next step prevents that step from sending; expired or invalid links cannot acknowledge; repeated clicks return the saved result; completed runs cannot be changed incorrectly; acknowledgement and in-flight sends are serialized.
- **Evidence:** [acknowledgement API](../src/main/java/com/alertops/flow_execution_engine/controller/EscalationAcknowledgementController.java), [acknowledgement service](../src/main/java/com/alertops/flow_execution_engine/service/EscalationAcknowledgementService.java), [email template](../src/main/java/com/alertops/messaging/Notification.java), [confirmation page](../ui/src/features/escalations/AcknowledgeEscalationPage.tsx), [database migration](../src/main/resources/db/migration/V4__add_escalation_acknowledgement.sql).

### Feature 2: Create and start an escalation through a webhook

- **Current state (source audit, 2026-10-08):** Core webhook implementation, task metadata presentation, complete event navigation, and local backend/UI verification are complete. PostgreSQL/Redis/deployed verification still prevents marking the whole feature complete.
- [x] Persist task source, priority, category, and reference URL; expose them through create/edit/read APIs and default manual source to “Manual”. Migration V5 also backfills existing task sources.
- [x] Add all metadata fields to the task creation form, show source/category in the task list, snapshot title/source into execution steps, and include title/source in email subject/body with wording suitable for alerts and other requests.
- [x] Complete manual task editing/detail UI and full task/run context display. The task library links to a detail/editor screen, exposes priority/category/reference links, and escalation details use the saved run snapshot.
- [x] Snapshot optional priority, category, and reference URL into execution steps and escalation emails so active and historical runs retain the task context from start time.
- [x] Implement team webhook configuration with a default response path and same-team `flowId` override, hashed secrets, rotation/disable, payload validation, a serialized-payload size check, and rate limiting. Configuration responses show a raw secret only on creation/rotation; owner/admin controls exist in the UI.
- [x] Require `eventId`, `taskName`, `description`, and `source`; create the task, run, execution steps, and full saved JSON event with linked IDs in one transaction using the shared start use case. Lock the webhook row and enforce unique `(webhookId, eventId)`; identical retries return existing records, while changed payloads return `409`.
- [x] Implement same-team event list/detail APIs and show saved events, JSON payloads, specific task-detail links, and run links in the webhook UI; configuration creation/view/rotation/disable are available.
- [x] Make older events accessible in the UI with an expandable full-history view while keeping the latest three events visible by default.
- [x] Align and verify input limits: manual and webhook descriptions use a 1,000-character server-side limit, manual priority validation is enforced, and declared webhook request sizes are rejected before JSON parsing. Redis rate limiting still has a per-instance fallback when Redis is unavailable; multi-instance abuse protection is not yet proven.
- [x] Add focused backend webhook tests for required/optional input validation, default/override flow selection, foreign-team isolation, secret rotation/disable, replay/conflict, failure-path rollback protection, and size/rate limits. UI metadata/event access remains covered by the separate UI items above.
- [ ] Verify PostgreSQL concurrent replay/rollback and the deployed webhook → task/run → email → acknowledgement journey, including restart and duplicate deliveries. Deployment checks remain deferred until implementation is complete.
- **Done when:** a valid request starts one task and run on the configured team and selected path, with the full event saved and linked to both; a request missing required task fields or naming a foreign flow saves nothing; retries do not create another run; invalid credentials and malformed payloads are rejected; the run can be acknowledged from its email.
- **Evidence:** [webhook service](../src/main/java/com/alertops/webhook/service/WebhookService.java), [event API](../src/main/java/com/alertops/webhook/controller/WebhookEventController.java), [configuration API](../src/main/java/com/alertops/webhook/controller/WebhookConfigurationController.java), [task API/service](../src/main/java/com/alertops/task/service/TaskService.java), [task/webhook migration](../src/main/resources/db/migration/V5__add_task_fields_and_webhooks.sql), [webhook UI](../ui/src/features/webhooks/WebhooksPage.tsx), [task UI](../ui/src/features/tasks/TasksPage.tsx), and [email template](../src/main/java/com/alertops/messaging/Notification.java). Remaining scope is in the [webhook plan](webhook-escalation-implementation-plan.md).
- **Local verification (2026-10-08):** Webhook/task-focused tests pass, including 13 webhook service tests, 3 payload-filter tests, and 3 task validation tests; full `./mvnw -q package` passes with 260 tests, 0 failures/errors, and 17 environment-gated skips; UI typecheck and production build pass, UI lint passes with two pre-existing flow-editor warnings, and `git diff --check` passes. These checks do not prove PostgreSQL concurrent replay/rollback, Redis multi-instance behavior, real email delivery, browser behavior, or deployed readiness; no live webhook or email was triggered during this task.

## Release check

- **Deployment decision (2026-10-11):** Version one uses Docker Compose for the
  backend, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, and Redis, plus UI hosting and HTTPS. Initial
  testing targets a minimal Oracle A1 VM in Mumbai; production hosting is pending
  confirmation. Kubernetes is deferred and its learning materials are preserved
  separately. See the [deployment guide](deployment/README.md).
- [ ] Prepare and verify the production VM/Compose setup, private dependency
  ports, HTTPS, external database backups, and recovery after a host restart.
- [x] Select and implement the public product identity using the [product rebranding plan](product-rebranding-plan.md). ReplyTrail is implemented locally; domain ownership, sender verification, and deployed rollout remain pending. Retain existing integration and storage identifiers during the initial rebrand.
- [x] All four critical fixes above are complete locally.
- [ ] A scheduled escalation that exhausts its start retries notifies the responsible user and team administrators. The pending notification survives an application crash and is recovered after restart.
- [ ] Both product features work together in a deployed end-to-end run: webhook event → one task and run → email → recipient acknowledgement → no later step sent.
- [ ] The same journey works after a restart and a duplicate webhook or queue delivery. The UI shows saved server state. `SENT` continues to mean SMTP acceptance unless actual delivery tracking is added.
