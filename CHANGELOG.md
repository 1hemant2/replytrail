# Changelog

Completed repository changes, newest first. Tracking begins on 2026-10-05;
earlier work has not been reconstructed. Planning and archive rules are in
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md#task-plans-and-documentation).

## 2026-10-11 — Rename the local workspace folder

- Rename `/Users/hemant/pers/alert_ops` to `/Users/hemant/pers/replytrail`,
  preserving files, Git metadata, and all uncommitted work.
- Verify the new working directory, unchanged Git status and origin, and diff
  checks. Reopen the workspace at the new path; no application code changed.

## 2026-10-11 — Align links with the ReplyTrail repository rename

- Update local origin fetch/push URLs and current documentation links to
  `1hemant2/replytrail`; preserve runtime compatibility identifiers and the
  existing workspace directory.
- Document repository-derived GHCR naming and the need to verify new image
  publication before deployment. No images or cloud resources were migrated.
- Verify GitHub's canonical URL, local remotes, documentation file links, and
  whitespace; Maven verify passes with opt-in integration checks skipped.
  No old repository URLs remain in the searched source tree.

## 2026-10-11 — Prepare open-source hosting applications

- Correct first-email timing and VM-hosting descriptions; add contribution and
  security-reporting guidance without changing application behavior.
- Prepare an [unsent hosting request](docs/deployment/hosting-request.md) with
  honest adoption and resource limits. GitHub description text is provided for
  manual update; sponsorship and private vulnerability reporting are not enabled
  by this change.
- Verification: relative documentation file links and diff checks pass; Maven
  verify passes outside the sandbox. Opt-in integration/deployed checks remain
  unverified; no applications were submitted.

## 2026-10-11 — Show the feature guide on the public home page

- Add a responsive, accessible feature guide to the public landing page with
  header and hero anchors, light/dark theme styling, and concise explanations of
  the current ReplyTrail workflow.
- Keep product boundaries visible by stating that unsupported channels and
  deferred test escalations are not included in the current product.
- Verification: UI build and diff checks pass. UI lint passes with two existing
  React hook warnings in the flow detail page; no new warnings were introduced.

## 2026-10-11 — Publish the ReplyTrail feature guide

- Add a single [feature guide](docs/features.md) with stable feature IDs,
  human-readable workflows, canonical lifecycle and security rules, API areas,
  implementation status, and deferred boundaries for people and AI agents.
- Link the guide from the README and align scheduling scope text with the local
  daily/weekly recurrence implementation. Preserve the distinction between local
  implementation and pending PostgreSQL/deployed verification.
- Verification: documentation links and whitespace checked with `git diff --check`;
  no backend or frontend behavior changed.

## 2026-10-11 — Clean up old Oracle deployment and prepare minimal test hosting

- Remove the approved old OKE cluster, worker pool, two A1 workers, and three
  47 GB boot volumes; retain the compartment and network. Boot-volume data was
  permanently deleted. Install OCI CLI and establish local authenticated access.
- Document the Oracle ARM64 test target and dedicated SSH access in the
  [deployment guide](docs/deployment/README.md). The 1 OCPU / 4 GB / 50 GB VM
  launch failed; the reduced 1 OCPU / 2 GB target also lacks capacity in all
  Mumbai fault domains and needs lower Compose limits plus load testing. No new
  VM or application deployment was created, and the task remains pending.
- Verify successful OKE cleanup, terminated workers/volumes, capacity reports,
  backend packaging with tests skipped, and diff checks. CI/CD remains pending.

## 2026-10-11 — Separate Kubernetes materials from the first release

- Move Kubernetes manifests and historical deployment learning guides into the
  separate local repository `/Users/hemant/pers/replytrail-kubernetes`; retain
  Docker, Compose, and CI here. Preserve the archive alongside the application
  so the deployment learning journey can continue later.
- Update the [deployment guide](docs/deployment/README.md) and release checklist
  for the agreed EC2/Compose direction. Production setup and deployment remain pending.
- Verification: all 18 archived files match Git history, updated links resolve,
  backend packaging with tests skipped and diff checks pass.

## 2026-10-11 — Implement minimum recurring escalation runs

- Implement daily/weekly repeat support on the existing escalation row with
  independent child IDs, atomic next-repeat advancement, restart recovery,
  stop-repeat, existing-screen controls, and source-run links. Defer advanced
  recurrence options and preserve one-time scheduling behavior.
- Verification: calendar unit test, backend test compilation/package, UI build,
  UI lint, and diff checks pass. Mockito service tests are blocked by local
  Byte Buddy self-attachment; PostgreSQL and deployed checks remain pending.

## 2026-10-10 — Move response steps to a numbered position

- Make drag targets select the final numbered position and add direct position
  selection to each card. Dragging, keyboard arrows, and selection share the
  same placement rule and refresh numbers from the saved order.
- Verification: four UI ordering tests, two backend reorder tests, UI build,
  and diff checks pass. Lint retains two existing flow-page warnings; browser
  interaction checks remain pending.

## 2026-10-10 — Use available space for escalation steps

- Replace the horizontal response-step strip with a responsive grid that fills
  the workspace width and scrolls vertically for long paths. Show numbered
  order across rows and retain step actions and reordering controls.
- Verification: UI build and diff checks pass; lint retains two existing
  flow-page warnings. Browser visual and interaction checks remain pending.

## 2026-10-10 — Keep growing workspace lists scrollable

- Bound growing workspace collections with responsive scrolling, themed
  scrollbars, and keyboard-accessible regions. Keep table headers visible and
  leave headings, filters, and actions above the scrolling content.
- Verification: UI build and `git diff --check` pass; lint retains the two
  existing flow-page warnings. Browser visual and interaction checks remain
  pending because browser access was unavailable.

## 2026-10-10 — Label task details in escalation emails

- Add a dedicated `Task details` section after the task metadata so the
  description is clearly separated in both plain-text and HTML email formats.
- Verification: `NotificationTest`, the backend package, and `git diff --check`
  pass. Visual SMTP-client inspection remains pending.

## 2026-10-10 — Send the first escalation alert immediately

- Send the first response-step email immediately for every start mode, include
  the escalation name, ID, and response window, and keep later-step timing and
  retry behavior unchanged.
- Restyle the HTML email as a compact dark responsive card with wrapped long
  values while preserving the plain-text fallback and safe action links.
- Verification: focused unit tests, seven PostgreSQL scheduling tests, the
  backend package, and `git diff --check` pass. SMTP delivery and multi-client
  visual inspection remain pending.

## 2026-10-10 — Register timers after escalation starts

- Publish scheduling events normally and let a Spring transaction event listener
  register them after commit, with immediate fallback for transactionless
  callers. Read committed state in a separate read-only transaction so cached
  pre-start statuses cannot silently prevent timer registration.
- Verification: seven focused PostgreSQL cases cover all start modes and due
  publication, zero delay, rollback, fallback, and recovery; the backend package
  passes with a test agent, and `git diff --check` passes. The local app needs a
  restart; real broker/email verification remains pending. See the
  [timer handoff guidance](docs/in-memory-timer-implementation-plan.md#durable-scheduling-state).

## 2026-10-10 — Style escalation notification email

- Refresh the escalation email with the ReplyTrail navy, mint, and blue
  palette, a branded header, a structured task panel, and clearer actions while
  preserving the plain-text fallback and recipient-scoped links.
- Verification: focused mail test and `./mvnw -q package` pass with 240 tests,
  0 failures/errors, and 17 environment-gated skips; `git diff --check` passes.
  Visual email-client inspection was unavailable.

## 2026-10-10 — Fix home-page theme toggle contrast

- Give the light-mode Dark button in the public home-page header readable
  foreground and border contrast without changing the persisted theme behavior.
- Verification: UI build and `git diff --check` pass; lint retains the two
  existing `FlowDetailPage.tsx` warnings, and browser visual inspection was not
  available in this session.

## 2026-10-09 — Simplify response-route scanning

- Keep the route card focused on the step count, Add response step, and a
  compact horizontal card rail with a visible next-card cue; move rail controls
  out of the header.
- Add a page-header Resolution timeout shortcut with an ON/OFF status that
  opens and scrolls to the existing path settings disclosure.
- Verification: UI build, lint, and `git diff --check` pass; protected route
  browser inspection was unavailable because the local browser session was at
  the login screen. Lint retains the two existing `FlowDetailPage.tsx`
  warnings.

## 2026-10-09 — Refine response-route navigation

- Restore the established compact response-step card size and add a partial
  next-card cue with accessible previous/next controls for longer routes.
- Verification: UI build, lint, `git diff --check`, and Chrome inspection of
  compact cards, overflow cues, and rail navigation pass; lint retains the two
  existing `FlowDetailPage.tsx` warnings.

## 2026-10-09 — Expand the response-route workspace

- Move Add response step into the route card and change the ordered steps to a
  spacious single-row rail that uses the available width and scrolls
  horizontally for longer paths.

  status and step progress while a run is `OPEN` or `ACKNOWLEDGED`, then stop
  polling for terminal and scheduled states.
- Verification: UI build, lint, `git diff --check`, and Chrome detail-page
  inspection pass; lint retains the two existing `FlowDetailPage.tsx` warnings.

## 2026-10-09 — Clarify response-step action icons

- Replace ambiguous Unicode glyphs with visible duplicate, edit, and delete
  icons, and add native guidance to the three-dot step action trigger.
- Verification: UI build, lint, `git diff --check`, and Chrome dark-theme menu
  inspection pass; lint retains the two existing `FlowDetailPage.tsx` warnings.

## 2026-10-09 — Add response-step duplication

- Add a Duplicate step action to each response-step menu; it copies the
  recipient, wait time, and enabled timeout, then places the new step after
  its source without requiring a trip back to the page header.
- Verification: UI build, lint, `git diff --check`, and Chrome menu and ordered
  duplicate inspection pass; lint retains the two existing
  `FlowDetailPage.tsx` warnings.

## 2026-10-09 — Focus escalation paths on response steps

- Make the ordered response route the primary path-detail view, move resolution
  timeout into a separate collapsed Path settings disclosure, and remove the
  repeated timeout field from step cards and the step editor.
- Verification: UI build, lint, `git diff --check`, and Chrome route, settings,
  and step-editor inspection pass; lint retains the two existing
  `FlowDetailPage.tsx` warnings.

## 2026-10-09 — Label collapsed sidebar icons on hover

  it inside the collapsed rail beneath the mark, making the control feel owned
  by the navigation while preserving mobile drawer access.
- Verification: UI build, lint, `git diff --check`, and Chrome expanded,
  collapsed, reopened, and light/dark inspection pass; lint retains the two
  existing `FlowDetailPage.tsx` warnings.

## 2026-10-09 — Restore dark-mode task detail contrast

- Add dark-theme colors for the saved task description, field labels, values,
  links, and metadata separators so task context remains readable against the
  dark card surface.
- Verification: UI build, lint, `git diff --check`, and Chrome light/dark task
  detail inspection pass; lint retains the two existing `FlowDetailPage.tsx`
  warnings.

## 2026-10-09 — Modernize the sidebar toggle

- Replace the text-heavy navigation control with a persistent icon-only
  panel-and-arrow toggle whose icon and accessible label follow the sidebar
  state; the same control expands and collapses navigation.
- Verification: UI build, lint, `git diff --check`, and Chrome expanded,
  collapsed, and reopened inspection pass; lint retains the two existing
  `FlowDetailPage.tsx` warnings.

## 2026-10-09 — Improve collapsed sidebar identity spacing

  collapsed, reopened, and scrolled inspection pass; lint retains the two
  existing `FlowDetailPage.tsx` warnings.

## 2026-10-09 — Polish team-selection theme spacing

- Give the team-selection theme toggle more breathing room and anchor the page
  to the viewport theme so dark mode no longer exposes a light strip at the top
  after switching.
- Verification: UI build, lint, `git diff --check`, and Chrome light/dark
  inspection pass; lint retains the two existing `FlowDetailPage.tsx` warnings.

## 2026-10-09 — Make sidebar reopening discoverable

- Add visible Menu and Open menu labels to the workspace navigation toggle so
  the collapsed sidebar has an obvious reopen action; keep the expanded sidebar
  branding clean and retain the accessible close control.
- Verification: UI build, lint, `git diff --check`, and Chrome expanded,
  collapsed, and reopened inspection pass; lint retains the two existing
  `FlowDetailPage.tsx` warnings.

## 2026-10-09 — Keep workspace navigation open and reachable

- Open the desktop sidebar by default on each page load while retaining the
  collapse/reopen control, and make the full navigation independently scrollable
  so the escalation engine and Sign out controls remain reachable.
- The existing landing and workspace copy already explains the product clearly
  on first view and remains unchanged. Verification: UI build, lint,
  `git diff --check`, and Chrome fresh-load, collapse/reopen, and sidebar-scroll
  inspection pass; lint retains the two existing `FlowDetailPage.tsx` warnings.

## 2026-10-09 — Refine workspace navigation spacing

  emails, notifications, templates, and user-facing documentation; replace the
  Audit page heading with “Review every handoff in one timeline.”
- Verification: targeted phrase search, UI build, lint, and `git diff --check`
  pass; lint retains the two existing `FlowDetailPage.tsx` warnings.

## 2026-10-09 — Add a frontend-only audit trail page

- Add a signed-in Audit trail page that aggregates all available escalation
  history through the existing APIs, with escalation links, actor/time/state
  context, search, event filtering, refresh, empty/error/loading states, and
  light/dark responsive styling; no backend changes were required.

- Add meaningful task, path, response, saved-state, handoff, and recovery icons
  to the setup/reliability cards, with accent rails, connected step styling,
  badges, softer surfaces, and clearer hover hierarchy.
- Verification: UI build, lint, and whitespace checks pass; lint retains the
  two existing `FlowDetailPage.tsx` warnings. Live workspace visual inspection
  was limited because the browser had no authenticated session.

## 2026-10-09 — Add clickable workspace breadcrumbs

- Add route-aware breadcrumbs to the signed-in shell so collection and detail
  pages expose clickable parent levels such as Team → Tasks → Task details.
- Verification: UI build, lint, and whitespace checks pass; live route-click
  inspection was limited because the browser had no authenticated workspace.

- Turn the four overview metric cards into semantic links to Tasks, Escalation
  paths, and Escalations, with full-card hover, focus, and arrow affordances.
- Verification: UI build, lint, and whitespace checks pass; live click testing
  was unavailable because the browser had no authenticated workspace session.

## 2026-10-09 — Unify the response tagline

- Replace the comma-based “Your response, in order.” overview title with the
  natural existing ReplyTrail tagline, “Keep every response on track.”
- Verification: UI build, lint, phrase search, and whitespace checks pass; the
  old phrase is absent from the product UI.

## 2026-10-09 — Improve email footer wording

- Replace the awkward comma-based footer slogan in invitation and escalation
  notification emails with the existing natural ReplyTrail tagline,
  “Keep every response on track.”
- Verification: backend package, wording search, and whitespace checks pass.

## 2026-10-09 — Add password visibility controls

  open accessible details for the scenario, owner handoff, timing, and finish
  condition; add a responsive signed-in workspace preview of an active run.
- Add theme-aware product-window, card, dialog, and mobile styling with
  reduced-motion-safe interactions, keeping the existing registration and sign-in
  paths unchanged.
- Verification: UI build and whitespace checks pass; Chrome inspection confirmed
  the preview, all cards, dialog content, and close behavior. Lint retains the
  two pre-existing `FlowDetailPage.tsx` warnings.

## 2026-10-09 — Load local env from the VS Code Java launch profile

- Configure the `AlertOpsApplication` debug profile to load the ignored root
  `.env` and send Spring logs to the integrated terminal.
- Verification: launch JSONC parsing and whitespace checks pass; the existing
  backend remains healthy on port 8096 with the same local env. The VS Code GUI
  launch itself remains a user-side F5 action.

## 2026-10-09 — Prepare the local full-stack environment

- Reconcile the ignored root `.env` with Docker Compose's PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ,
  Redis, UI URL, and application defaults; add ignored `ui/.env` with the local
  Vite proxy configuration and add the missing email-verification example key.
- Install Docker CLI/Compose and native PostgreSQL 16/RabbitMQ dependencies;
  start the native services and initialize the local `alert_ops` database using
  the existing ignored credentials without exposing secret values.
- Verification: Compose config, backend compile, UI build, Vite proxy, backend
  liveness, Flyway migrations, and native service checks pass. Docker/Colima VM
  image downloads stalled, so the app was verified with native services instead.

## 2026-10-09 — Improve light-mode contrast and home-page engagement

- Strengthen light-mode text, border, control, card, and secondary-surface
  contrast for easier reading across the UI.
- Add workflow-benefit cues, a ready-to-run workflow count, richer public-section
  surfaces, hover feedback, and subtle reduced-motion-safe status animation.
- Verification: UI build, lint, diff checks, desktop/mobile Chrome inspection,
  and light/dark theme checks pass; lint retains two pre-existing warnings.

## 2026-10-08 — Add persisted dark mode to the UI

- Add a local-storage-backed light/dark theme with pre-paint restoration and
  accessible toggles across public, auth, workspace, team, invitation, and
  email-action surfaces.
- Add dark styling for shared navigation, forms, cards, notices, statuses, path
  builders, and public use-case sections without changing product behavior.
- Verification: UI build, lint, diff checks, public switching/reload, and sign-in
  screen inspection pass; lint retains two pre-existing FlowDetailPage warnings.

## 2026-10-08 — Bring ReplyTrail use cases to the home page

- Add a scannable public landing-page section for all thirteen README use cases,
  with plain-language descriptions, responsive cards, a hero anchor link, and
  the existing SVG favicon linked for a clean browser preview.
- Verification: UI build, `git diff --check`, and Chrome desktop/400px responsive
  inspection pass; the hero anchor and existing signup links work. UI lint retains
  two pre-existing FlowDetailPage warnings; live email and deployed journeys were
  not tested.

## 2026-10-08 — Explain ReplyTrail and its use cases

- Rewrite the [README](README.md) introduction for new visitors with thirteen use
  cases in plain language and definitions of the core concepts. Simplify setup
  and ten personal reminders, keeping timing and acknowledgement behavior clear;
  remove the extended customer onboarding walkthrough.
- Document current scheduling, resolution, manual actions, and history; correct
  the first-use walkthrough and Spring Boot version while retaining setup/API examples.
- Verification: UI build, Maven verification outside the sandbox (240 tests,
  17 environment-gated skips), link/example checks, and whitespace checks pass. UI lint retains two
  existing warnings; live email, Docker startup, and deployed journeys were not tested.

## 2026-10-08 — Remove mandatory secondary review instructions

- Remove the repository-level requirement and maintained-plan references that
  caused an extra review process to run for every task.
- Preserve historical changelog evidence while keeping current instructions
  focused on direct local verification.
- Verification: targeted instruction search and `git diff --check` pass; no
  product build was needed for this documentation-only change.

## 2026-10-08 — Implement the ReplyTrail public rebrand

- Rename visible product surfaces, metadata, current documentation, CI display
  labels, verification/invitation mail, and escalation notifications to ReplyTrail.
- Keep `com.alertops`, `alertops.*`, `ALERTOPS_*`, webhook headers, session keys,
  queues, caches, and deployment identifiers unchanged for compatibility; domain,
  sender, and deployed rollout work remain pending.
- Verification: UI build and 14 focused branding/email tests pass; full Maven clean
  verification passes (240 tests, 17 environment-gated skips); lint retains two
  existing FlowDetailPage warnings. Independent read-only review: **Achieved**;
  residual references, compatibility paths, and 132 documentation links/anchors
  were checked. Browser/deployed, domain, sender, and real-delivery checks remain pending.

## 2026-10-08 — Plan the product rebrand

- Add a [phased product rebranding plan](docs/product-rebranding-plan.md) covering
  identity selection, UI and emails, compatibility, verification, rollout, and rollback.
- Link the pending initiative from launch readiness; final name/domain selection
  and implementation remain open. This task changes documentation only.
- Verification: document links, diff checks, UI build, and full Maven verification
  pass (238 tests, 17 environment-gated skips); lint retains two existing warnings.
  Independent read-only review: Achieved; runtime/deployed checks await implementation.

## 2026-10-08 — Fix CI container image build

- Remove brittle exact Jammy OpenSSL package pins while continuing to install
  the current patched `libssl3` and `openssl` packages from the pinned base.
- Add plain Docker build output and a failure-log artifact to make future image
  failures diagnosable.
- Verification: GitHub Actions run `37686152716` passed Maven verification,
  container image build, and Trivy scanning; local Docker was unavailable.

## 2026-10-08 — Fix Spring Boot 4 integration-test imports

- Update integration-test Redis, JDBC, JPA, AMQP, and entity-scan imports to
  the Spring Boot 4 packages and class names, restoring clean CI compilation.
- Verification: clean test compilation and `./mvnw --batch-mode
  --no-transfer-progress clean verify` pass with 238 tests, 0 failures/errors,
  and 17 environment-gated skips; `git diff --check` passes.

## 2026-10-08 — Complete webhook event history UI

- Add expandable webhook event history and link each event to its specific task
  detail page while preserving the existing run and payload links.
- Verification: UI typecheck and production build pass; lint passes with two
  pre-existing flow-editor warnings, and `git diff --check` passes. PostgreSQL,
  Redis, browser, and deployed verification remain pending.

## 2026-10-08 — Complete task and run context UI

- Add team-scoped task detail/editing, metadata links, and saved task context on
  escalation details using the run snapshot rather than mutable task values.
- Verification: UI typecheck and production build pass; lint passes with two
  pre-existing flow-editor warnings. Browser/deployed verification and older
  webhook event navigation remain pending.

## 2026-10-08 — Snapshot task metadata in executions and emails

- Persist priority, category, and reference URL in each execution-step snapshot
  at run start and include the saved values in escalation email content without
  changing later runs when the task is edited.
- Add migration and focused coverage; `./mvnw -q package` passes with 260 tests,
  0 failures/errors, and 17 environment-gated skips. PostgreSQL migration and
  deployed email verification remain pending; task/webhook UI gaps remain open.

## 2026-10-08 — Fix backend image vulnerabilities

- Upgrade the backend to Spring Boot `4.0.8`/Spring Framework `7.0.9`, apply fixed
  Jackson, RabbitMQ, and Tomcat versions, refresh pinned container bases, and update
  the Hibernate 7 and MVC test compatibility imports.
- Verification: backend Maven dependencies report no HIGH or CRITICAL findings,
  `./mvnw -q package` passes with 260 tests and 17 environment-gated skips, and
  `git diff --check` passes. Final Docker image build/scan remains for CI because
  Docker is unavailable locally; the UI has a separate `source-map-js` finding.

## 2026-10-08 — Refresh launch checklist reassessment date

- Update the product launch checklist header to reflect the latest readiness review date without changing any implementation or production-verification status.
- Verification: documentation diff review and `git diff --check` pass; no runtime tests were needed and the change remains uncommitted.

## 2026-10-08 — Harden webhook task validation and ingress limits

- Align manual and webhook task limits, validate manual priority and description updates, inject the application clock for webhook event timing, and reject oversized declared webhook bodies before JSON parsing.
- Add focused coverage for webhook metadata, required/optional validation, same-team flow selection, secret state, replay/conflict, failure paths, size/rate limits, and manual task limits.
- Verification: focused tests and `./mvnw -q package` pass (260 tests, 0 failures/errors, 17 environment-gated skips); PostgreSQL/Redis multi-instance and deployed verification remain pending, and changes are intentionally uncommitted.

## 2026-10-08 — Complete incident lifecycle test coverage

- Add focused authorization and lifecycle-boundary tests for anonymous access, foreign-team starts, early scheduled starts, and preserving scheduler wake-ups when a start fails; retain the existing race, idempotency, acknowledgement, resolution, and timeout coverage.
- Mark incident lifecycle implementation complete locally while keeping PostgreSQL and deployed verification open.
- Verification: lifecycle-focused tests, full Maven package, and diff checks pass; PostgreSQL/deployed integration and independent read-only verification remain unavailable. Changes are intentionally uncommitted.

## 2026-10-08 — Add escalation activity timeline UI

- Add a read-only escalation activity section backed by the paginated history API, with plain milestone wording, actor/time/details, retry grouping, expandable attempts, empty/error/loading states, refresh, and load-more behavior.
- Keep current saved step progress separate and invalidate activity history after lifecycle actions; token-like and raw metadata remain excluded from the UI.
- Verification: UI build, UI lint, full Maven package, and diff checks pass; lint has two pre-existing flow-page warnings, browser/deployed verification remains pending, and no independent read-only verifier was available. Changes are intentionally uncommitted.

## 2026-10-08 — Add escalation activity history API

- Add a read-only, same-team paginated escalation history endpoint with stable ordering, explicit user/system actors, structured safe details, and removal of token-like metadata.
- Verification: focused history tests, full Maven package (232 tests, 0 failures/errors, 17 environment-gated skips), and diff checks pass; PostgreSQL/deployed verification remains pending. Changes are intentionally uncommitted.

## 2026-10-08 — Extend escalation audit event coverage

- Add creation, notification acceptance/failure/retry, and final exhaustion events with safe step, recipient, attempt, deadline, and system/actor context; preserve existing acknowledgement, manual escalation, resolution, timeout, scheduling, start, cancellation, and start-failure events.
- Verification: focused lifecycle/audit tests, full Maven package, and diff checks pass; infrastructure-gated and deployed verification remain pending. Changes are intentionally uncommitted.

## 2026-10-08 — Complete escalation and email UI

- Add team and recipient resolution controls, saved resolution-deadline display, lifecycle-aware acknowledgement messaging, and readable paused/sent/failed/skipped step explanations.
- Improve Escalate now stale, expired, and unavailable-action messaging and expose the existing resolution API through the UI.
- Verification: UI production build, focused acknowledgement/resolution tests, and backend package build pass; PostgreSQL/deployed verification remains pending.

## 2026-10-08 — Simplify manual Escalate now code

- Remove four redundant helper methods and rename the remaining internal helpers to explicit business names while preserving authorization, locking, deadline, token, audit, and idempotency behavior.
- Update `AGENTS.md` to prefer the smallest readable implementation and to remove wrappers or abstractions that do not protect a real boundary.
- Verification: focused manual-action/security tests, backend package build, and `git diff --check` pass; PostgreSQL/deployed verification remains pending.

## 2026-10-08 — Clarify Escalate now transition naming

- Rename the private manual-action helper from `applyLocked` to `applyEscalateNowTransition` so its business responsibility is explicit while preserving behavior.
- Verification: focused manual-action tests, backend package build, and `git diff --check` pass.

## 2026-10-08 — Implement Escalate now

- Add authenticated same-team and recipient-token Escalate now actions for OPEN and ACKNOWLEDGED runs, with expected-step validation, immediate durable scheduling, resolution-wait cancellation, explicit token capability, and actor/source/target audit details.
- Add signed-in and email preview/confirmation UI plus an Escalate now email action for non-final notifications; stale, terminal, expired, and repeated actions remain scoped and idempotent.
- Verification: focused manual-action, acknowledgement, notification, consumer, and security tests; full Maven suite (224 tests, 0 failures/errors, 17 environment-gated skips); backend package; UI build; and diff checks pass. PostgreSQL/RabbitMQ/Redis and deployed verification remain pending; no independent read-only verifier was available.

## 2026-10-07 — Make naming guidance business-focused

- Update `AGENTS.md` to prioritize business responsibilities and user-visible outcomes over implementation mechanisms when naming classes and methods, with concise timeout examples.
- Verification: naming-guidance review, `git diff --check`, plan-length check, and backend compile pass; no runtime behavior changed, so the full test suite was not rerun.

## 2026-10-07 — Use clear timeout terminology for escalation waits

- Replace internal `deadline` component names with `EscalationTimeoutService`, `EscalationTimeoutScheduler`, and related timeout messages; explain that acknowledgement timeout exhausts an open escalation while resolution timeout resumes the next step or exhausts the run.
- Preserve the canonical persisted `resolutionDeadline` field and `dueAt` boundary; only internal names, comments, and audit detail labels changed.
- Verification: focused timeout, acknowledgement, and resolution tests; full Maven suite (190 tests, 0 failures/errors, 17 environment-gated skips); backend package; UI build; compile; and diff/name checks pass. PostgreSQL/deployed verification remains pending, and no independent read-only verifier was available.

## 2026-10-07 — Clarify previous deadline component naming

- Rename the durable deadline transition component to `EscalationDeadlineTransitionService` and the in-memory timer owner to `EscalationDeadlineWakeUpScheduler`; clarify their class documentation and dependency names without changing lifecycle behavior.
- Verification: focused deadline, acknowledgement, and resolution tests; full Maven suite (190 tests, 0 failures/errors, 17 environment-gated skips); backend package; UI build; and diff/name checks pass. PostgreSQL/deployed verification remains pending, and no independent read-only verifier was available.

## 2026-10-07 — Clarify method names and comments in deadline handling

- Add concise explicit naming and one-line method-comment rules to `AGENTS.md`.
- Rename deadline recovery, wake-up, delivery, and scheduling methods to state their purpose; replace `rearm` terminology with `rescheduleDeadlineWakeUp` and update related tests/docs without changing lifecycle behavior.
- Verification: focused tests, full Maven suite (190 tests, 0 failures/errors, 17 environment-gated skips), backend package, UI build, and diff/document checks pass. PostgreSQL/deployed verification remains pending.

## 2026-10-07 — Implement deadline expiry and recovery

- Persist shared acknowledgement boundaries after successful sends, recover final acknowledgement/resolution deadlines after restart, and safely expire or resume/exhaust runs under the database lock.
- Enforce acknowledgement deadlines on POST and record automatic acknowledgement/resolution expiry audit events without adding parallel timing fields.
- Verification: full Maven tests (190 tests, 0 failures/errors, 17 environment-gated skips), backend package, UI build, focused expiry/recovery tests, and documentation checks pass. PostgreSQL/deployed concurrency, rollback, and restart verification remains pending.

## 2026-10-07 — Implement explicit resolution

- Add locked team-member and recipient-token resolution from `ACKNOWLEDGED` to `RESOLVED`, with actor/time persistence, active-owner clearing, unsent-step skipping, audit history, and post-commit wake-up cancellation.
- Enforce the saved resolution deadline and exact current recipient/step ownership; use the saved deadline rather than token TTL for action eligibility and require exact accepted token-hash/step/source audit evidence for idempotent recipient replays.
- Verification: focused resolution/security tests, full Maven tests (177 tests, 0 failures/errors), backend package, UI build, and documentation checks pass. Independent read-only review was **Inconclusive** only for PostgreSQL/deployed migration, rollback, and concurrency behavior because PostgreSQL/RabbitMQ/Redis integration checks remain environment-gated.

## 2026-10-07 — Implement acknowledgement pause

- Add the enabled `ACKNOWLEDGED` lifecycle transition, exact current-step validation, saved resolution owner/deadline, next-step pause, and post-commit wake-up cancellation while preserving disabled terminal acknowledgement behavior.
- Keep successful final sends open for acknowledgement and record the acknowledgement audit event; `dueAt` remains the shared acknowledgement/delivery boundary with no redundant acknowledgement-deadline field.
- Verification: focused tests, full Maven tests, backend package, UI build, and documentation checks pass. PostgreSQL/RabbitMQ/Redis integration checks remain environment-gated; independent read-only verifier verdict: **Achieved**.

## 2026-10-06 — Clarify agreed-decision implementation guardrails

- Require implementation plans to identify binding agreed decisions and canonical sources of truth before adding fields, columns, timers, or API properties.
- Require conflicting earlier implementation and tests to be removed or revised when the user clarifies a decision, with focused re-verification before handoff.
- Verification: documentation whitespace, plan-length, anchor, and diff checks pass.

## 2026-10-06 — Persist runtime resolution snapshots

- Add V13 durable per-step resolution snapshots, run-level acknowledgement ownership/resolution deadlines, and exact execution-step binding for acknowledgement tokens; reuse `dueAt` as the canonical shared acknowledgement/delivery deadline.
- Propagate the flow/node snapshot through immediate and scheduled starts, with focused coverage for enabled/disabled timing, failed writes, same-recipient steps, and mismatched tokens.
- Follow-up correction removes the redundant per-step acknowledgement-deadline column so the shared wait has one durable time source.
- Verification: focused tests, full `mvn test`, backend packaging, UI build, documentation checks, and diff review pass. PostgreSQL/RabbitMQ/Redis integration remains environment-gated and skipped; independent read-only verifier verdict: **Achieved**. PostgreSQL rollback/migration execution remained unavailable.

## 2026-10-06 — Add flow/node resolution timing configuration

- Add the flow-level resolution-timeout toggle, nullable positive per-node timeout storage, version-checked atomic timing updates, and matching create/edit validation.
- Add flow-editor controls for enabling the timeout and setting each node's resolution window while retaining the existing shared wait duration.
- Update the PostgreSQL scheduling fixtures to pass the unified execution-step enum, preserving full-suite compilation after the preceding status migration.
- Verification: focused flow tests, full `mvn test`, backend packaging, UI build, documentation checks, and diff review pass. PostgreSQL/Redis/RabbitMQ integration tests remain environment-gated and skipped; independent read-only verification was unavailable.

## 2026-10-06 — Unify execution-step statuses

- Replace the independent execution/notification status strings with the persisted `FlowExecutionStepStatus` enum, migrate legacy rows with V11, rebuild publication recovery queries, and reject unsupported database values.
- Update delivery/retry/duplicate-message paths, disabled acknowledgement skip handling, execution-state API/UI mappings, and focused tests so each step has one authoritative status.
- Verification: focused tests, full `mvn test`, backend packaging, and `npm run build` pass. PostgreSQL integration remains skipped by its environment gate (13 skipped tests); independent read-only verification was inconclusive because two dispatched verifier attempts did not return reports and were shut down.

## 2026-10-06 — Settle resolution lifecycle storage semantics

- Decide that `RESOLVED` is self-describing, while `COMPLETED` requires `ACKNOWLEDGED` or `EXHAUSTED`; clear active acknowledgement ownership when the run leaves that state and retain history in audit events.
- Mark the resolution-timeout requirements prerequisite complete in the [launch checklist](docs/product-launch-readiness.md#3-resolution-timeout-after-acknowledgement); implementation remains pending, with execution-step status unification selected as the next task.
- Verification: focused documentation diff review, link/anchor, whitespace, and plan-length checks passed. Product tests/builds were not applicable; independent subagent verification was skipped because no usable subagent mechanism was exposed.

## 2026-10-06 — Require independent subagent completion verification

- Update [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md#verification-and-handoff) to require a read-only verification subagent for each repository task, with acceptance-criteria evidence, an explicit verdict, and documented limitations before handoff.
- Require the primary agent to reconcile the verifier's report and record when the environment cannot provide a subagent; no product behavior changed.
- Verification: local documentation links/anchors, whitespace, plan length, and diff review passed. An independent verifier initially returned `Not achieved` because the task plan and changelog still said verification was pending; that report was reconciled, and a final verifier returned `Achieved`. A later audit was `Inconclusive` only because its child context could not recursively verify the parent-run subagent mechanism; the parent had successfully used that mechanism, and recursive verification is not required. Documentation linters and product tests/builds were not applicable or unavailable.

## 2026-10-06 — Document Spring test-context dependency checks

- Add [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md#verification-and-handoff) guidance to update `@WebMvcTest`/slice-test mocks and direct constructor tests whenever Spring constructor dependencies change.
- Require focused context verification and diagnosis of the first underlying `UnsatisfiedDependencyException`; no product behavior changed.
- Verification: whitespace, plan length, and diff review pass. Changes remain uncommitted.

## 2026-10-06 — Restore security test context wiring

- Add the missing `EscalationStartScheduler` Mockito bean to the MVC security test after the controller gained that constructor dependency.
- Anonymous escalation, schedule, reschedule, and cancel requests continue to verify `401` responses; production wiring is unchanged.
- Verification: focused `EscalationSecurityTest` and backend packaging pass. Changes remain uncommitted.

## 2026-10-06 — Require separate commits by change category

- Update [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md#scope-and-version-control) to keep backend, frontend, test, and documentation changes in separate commits, requiring confirmation before committing to split mixed staging and using a fixed backend-to-documentation order.
- Preserve unrelated unstaged changes while separating commits; no product behavior changed.
- Verification: documentation links/anchors, whitespace, plan length, and diff review pass. Changes remain uncommitted.

## 2026-10-06 — Require explicit mode APIs in agent guidance

- Update [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md#changes) to prohibit overloaded methods and boolean mode flags for materially different business behavior; require explicit enums/request objects or clearly named operations with focused mode tests.
- This documents the `startFlowExecution` refactoring practice for future work. No product behavior or existing staged changes were changed.
- Verification: documentation links/anchors, whitespace, and current-plan length checks pass; no behavior tests or builds were needed.

## 2026-10-06 — Simplify flow execution start modes

- Replace the overloaded/boolean `startFlowExecution` API with one explicit `FlowExecutionStartMode` enum covering idle, due scheduled, and early scheduled starts.
- Update all callers and focused tests without changing claims, transaction boundaries, actor auditing, first-step delays, or timer behavior.
- Verification: focused Maven tests, backend packaging, UI build, and diff/whitespace checks pass. The implementation is recorded in the preceding implementation commit.

## 2026-10-06 — Implement Start now for scheduled escalations

- Allow same-team users to start a scheduled escalation early through the existing start API, using a conditional `SCHEDULED → OPEN` claim, normal first-step delay, actor audit, and post-commit timer cancellation.
- Add scheduled-run UI wording and focused use-case, service, controller, and scheduling tests. Automatic due-time starts remain due-gated; PostgreSQL/deployed verification remains pending.
- Verification: focused Maven tests, backend packaging, UI build, and diff/whitespace checks pass. Resolution, Escalate now, webhook gaps, and activity timeline remain separate tasks.

## 2026-10-06 — Correct webhook launch progress from implementation evidence

- Audit existing webhook/task backend, UI, migrations, and email code; replace stale unchecked tracking in [Feature 2](docs/product-launch-readiness.md#feature-2-create-and-start-an-escalation-through-a-webhook) with completed implementation pieces and explicit remaining metadata, event-history, validation, and verification gaps.
- Mark the existing webhook plan partially implemented, not release-ready. No product code was changed or repaired in this audit.
- Verification: the existing mocked-SMTP Notification test, backend packaging, UI build, and document checks pass. Webhook-specific tests are absent; PostgreSQL webhook behavior and deployed end-to-end checks were not run.

## 2026-10-06 — Defer Send test escalation until after launch

- Move Send test escalation to the [feature backlog](docs/feature-backlog.md#send-test-escalation) and remove it from initial-launch requirements. Revisit after real users start using AlertOps; detailed test behavior remains undecided.
- Verification: documentation links/anchors and whitespace checks only. No product code, lifecycle states, or other release requirements changed.

## 2026-10-06 — Clarify the shared acknowledgement and delivery wait

- Correct the [lifecycle plan](docs/resolution-timeout-implementation-plan.md#agreed-uniform-node-waits-and-final-step-outcome) and Requirement 3: existing delivery delay is the acknowledgement wait, not another duration to stack or compare. Resolution duration starts at acknowledgement when enabled; unresolved expiry advances immediately.
- Remove the reopened timing question and add a shared-wait verification example. No new setting or state is planned; implementation and deployed verification remain pending.
- Verification: documentation links/anchors and whitespace checks only; product code is unchanged and no behavior or deployed tests ran.

## 2026-10-06 — Settle email Escalate now eligibility

- Record current-recipient acknowledgement/resolution windows for [email Escalate now](docs/resolution-timeout-implementation-plan.md#escalate-now-from-email); links stay viewable after expiry or advancement, but cannot advance another step through repeated confirmation.
- Update Requirements 3/4 and planned boundary, race, restart, and duplicate-click checks. Carry forward the closed resolution-access decision using existing same-team rules, with no new roles or states.
- Verification: documentation links/anchors and whitespace checks only; implementation and deployed verification remain pending. No product code or commits changed.

## 2026-10-06 — Record viewable links with deadline-gated response actions

- Record [acknowledgement/resolution action rules](docs/resolution-timeout-implementation-plan.md#agreed-viewable-links-and-action-deadlines): keep links viewable, reject new late/obsolete actions, and show saved outcomes for previously accepted actions without restarting timers.
- Update Requirement 3 and acceptance cases for independent deadlines, stale links, delayed timers, and restart. Correct planning wording to retain the already-agreed two node response durations without another setting; resolution permissions and email Escalate now eligibility remain open.
- Verification: documentation links/anchors and whitespace checks; product implementation remains pending, with no behavior or deployed tests run.

## 2026-10-05 — Plan uniform node waits and final-step exhaustion

- Record [uniform node rules](docs/resolution-timeout-implementation-plan.md#agreed-uniform-node-waits-and-final-step-outcome): the last recipient gets the same acknowledgement/resolution waits; expired waits with no next step exhaust the run, without resending.
- Update Requirement 3 and implementation/recovery acceptance cases. Acknowledgement-window configuration remains open because the current node duration is a pre-send delay; no special final-node timeout is planned.
- Verification: documentation checks only; no product code or implementation-readiness claims changed, and no behavior or deployed tests ran.

## 2026-10-05 — Plan readable incident activity history

- Add the agreed user/automatic event history, important milestones, and expandable
  failure/retry summaries to the [shared lifecycle plan](docs/resolution-timeout-implementation-plan.md#agreed-incident-activity-timeline).
- Mark Requirement 5 agreed and plan audit coverage, a team-scoped history API, and
  detail-page presentation; implementation and deployed verification remain pending.
- Verification: documentation checks only; product code is unchanged and no behavior
  or deployed tests ran. Existing passing backend/UI builds are unchanged.

## 2026-10-05 — Plan early scheduled starts and manual escalation from UI or email

- Extend the [shared lifecycle plan](docs/resolution-timeout-implementation-plan.md)
  with Start now for scheduled runs and Escalate now for waiting/paused next steps,
  including email-token preview/POST confirmation, recipient audit, stale-link checks,
  transactions, timer cleanup, races, and focused implementation tasks.
- Mark Requirement 4 agreed while keeping implementation pending; the activity
  timeline and remaining resolution edge cases still need discussion.
- Verification: documentation links/anchors and whitespace checks passed. Product code
  is unchanged; prior passing backend/UI builds were reused, and no behavior tests ran.

## 2026-10-05 — Plan resolution timeout after acknowledgement

- Record the agreed flow toggle, per-node timeouts, runtime snapshots, single
  step-status enum, and immediate next-step delivery when resolution expires in
  the [feature plan](docs/resolution-timeout-implementation-plan.md).
- Link Requirement 3 to ordered implementation tasks and identify the remaining
  product decisions; implementation and release verification remain pending.
- Verification: local document-link targets, whitespace checks, backend packaging,
  and UI build passed. No behavior tests or deployed checks ran for this documentation task.

## 2026-10-05 — Require concise task plans and maintain a changelog

- Require a plan before each implementation and reuse one current task plan to
  limit document growth.
- Define when to reuse feature plans, maintain lasting documentation, and archive
  completed plans and older changelog entries.
- Verification: document links and whitespace checks, backend packaging, and UI
  build passed. Tests and deployed checks were not run for this documentation-only change.
